# Filewave-macOS-Updates

The purpose of this project is to provide a different method for installing macOS
updates via Filewave. This method will perform a scripted install using the softwareupdates
command, instead of using Filewave's built-in method of deploying updates. This
method is largely adapted from https://github.com/bp88/JSS-Scripts/blob/master/AppleSoftwareUpdate.sh

Why?

I haven't had great luck with Filewave's built-in OS updater for macOS.
Works fine for Windows, but with changes Apple has made for update catalogs, bridgeOS
updates, various delta's, etc, it seems harder and harder for Filewave to handle this.
LANrev was having similar problems before its demise.

The other reason is to have a set-it-and-forget-it model. If you want your fleet
to install updates without needing your approval, this model works great. Combine
it with a software update delay profile if you don't want updates installed as soon
as they come out.

## Setup

The original script, insteaded for Jamf Pro, has been broken out to 3 scripts. Create a fileset with an empty payload. Add these three scripts to the appropriate script section.

### fw_softwareupdates_verification.sh

This script will determine if updates are required. As well as check that other conditions
are met, such as confirming the device is connected to power, filevault is not in
the process of encrypting, and there are no power assertions (presentation or web conferencing apps)

### fw_downloadupdates_preflight.sh

If the previous script passed, this script will download the updates before the user
is prompted to install. Add this script to "Preflight Scripts"

### fw_softwareupdate_activation.sh

This activation script is what performs the installation of the updates that were previously updated.
